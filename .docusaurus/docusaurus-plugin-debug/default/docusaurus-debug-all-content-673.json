Additionally, platforms have their own objectives ranging from growing both buyer and seller user bases to revenue maximization. It is not difficult to see that it would be challenging to obtain a globally favorable outcome for all parties. Taking the search experience as an example, any interventions are likely to impact either buyers or sellers unfairly to course correct for a greater perceived need.",

The data starts on 2015–01–28, and has monthly records of the products each customer has, such as a credit card, savings account, etc. In addition, the dataset also records user personal data such as average income, age, gender, and so on. The monthly statistics are provided until 2015–05–28. Finally, the model predicts which additional products a customer will start using from the following month, 2016–06–28. Thus, the dataset spans 17 months from 2015–01–28 to 2016–05–28, and the output set contains only the timestamp corresponding to 2016–06–28. Models are therefore trained on sequences of 16 months to predict products acquired on their respective last month.",

This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference.",

The asynchronous nature of the algorithm allows the agent to learn from different parts of the state space, allowing parallel learning and faster convergence.

The order of interaction implies that sequential patterns play an important role where more recent items in a sequence have a larger impact on the next item. Convolutional Sequence Embedding Recommendation Model (Caser) address this requirement by embedding a sequence of recent items into an image' in the time and latent spaces and learn sequential patterns as local features of the image using convolutional filters.

              "description": "The Q-learning component of DQN was invented in 1989 by Christopher Watkins in his PhD thesis titled “Learning from Delayed Rewards”. Experience replay quickly followed, invented by Long-Ji Lin in 1992. This played a major role in improving the efficiency of Q-learning. In the years that followed, however, there were no major success stories involving deep Q-learning. This is perhaps not surprising given the combination of limited computational power in the 1990s and early 2000s, data-hungry deep learning architectures, and the sparse, noisy, and delayed feedback signals experienced in RL. Progress had to wait for the emergence of general-purpose GPU programming, for example with the launch of CUDA in 2006, and the reignition of interest in deep learning within the machine learning community that began in the mid-2000s and rapidly accelerated after 2012.",

              "description": "VSKNN stands for Vector Multiplication Session-Based kNN. The idea of this variant is to put more emphasis on the more recent events of a session when computing the similarities. Instead of encoding a session as a binary vector, we use real-valued vectors to encode the current session. Only the very last element of the session obtains a value of “1”; the weights of the other elements are determined using a linear decay function that depends on the position of the element within the session, where elements appearing earlier in the session obtain a lower weight. As a result, when using the dot product as a similarity function between the current weight-encoded session and a binary-encoded past session, more emphasis is given to elements that appear later in the sessions.",
